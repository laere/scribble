# scribble

A WIP Blog made from scratch. Challenging my abilities as a developer to create applications that are scalable and don't suck. 


<h1>THINGS TO DO:</h1>

Continue planning out routing, and what the blog will consist of.

Get a DB set up (Probably MySQL) as a single source of truth.

Plan out what the state will consist of, and any data structuring for said state. 

Define what containers will do what, what components they will consist of, and what those components will do (single responsibility principal)

Satisfy the seperation of concerns. 

Once this is done, then start working on the physical aspects, such as fleshing out the containers and components.
